# Mapper-Reducer-Implementation

The objective of this mini project is to find the words and their count by implementing mapper reducer algorithm in Python. Executed mapper reducer functionality using python to represent the Hadoop infrastructure using the "Pride and Prejudice" book as the input data file. Implemented multi-threading to simultaneously execute operations of two mapper and reducer functions. We defined functions to perform all the transformations of the data. Multithreading in Python mirrors exactly how it happens in Spark when you execute a command where it simultaneously executes two or more parts of a program to maximum utilize the CPU time.
